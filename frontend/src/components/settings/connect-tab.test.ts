/**
 * The Fyers login opens a tab synchronously on the click, then navigates it once the authorize
 * URL comes back from the backend. That two step shape exists because a window.open issued after
 * an await has lost the user gesture and is blocked, but it only works if the handle survives.
 *
 * This file guards the one mistake that silently breaks it: passing noopener. That feature makes
 * window.open return null by specification, so the handle is lost and the tab that was just
 * opened sits blank forever while the backend reports a perfectly healthy 200.
