"""Resolution, creation and locking of the application data directory.

Everything the app owns lives under a single 0700 directory, `~/.expirymanager` by default. Three
rules are enforced here rather than left to callers:

1. The process umask is 0o077 before any file is created. A later chmod is not equivalent: SQLite
   creates the `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars itself and DuckDB creates its `.wal`, so a chmod on the
   main database leaves a window in which the sidecars were world readable, and nothing ever
   chmods them at all. Windows has no umask and no mode bits, so this rule is a POSIX one and
   `MODE_BITS_ARE_MEANINGFUL` records where it applies.
2. The directory is refused if it resolves under a known cloud sync root. A sync client copying a
   WAL out from under two open databases corrupts both, and it uploads the key file while it is
   at it.
3. Startup takes an advisory lock. DuckDB reports a second instance as an IOException that reads
   like corruption, and a user who sees that will reasonably reach for a backup they do not need.

# wrapped. The odds are about one key in nine, so it is the kind of fault that passes a test run
